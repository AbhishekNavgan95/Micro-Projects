# Modern Text Animation Micro Project

This micro project demonstrates a modern text animation effect inspired by contemporary website designs. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library for smooth animations.

### Project Overview

The main focus of this project is to create an eye-catching text animation effect applied to specific elements with the class "hover." The text within these elements is transformed into individual spans, and on mouse hover, each character undergoes a 3D rotation animation.

### Features

- **Text Animation**: The text within designated elements is transformed into spans, and on hover, each character rotates individually for a dynamic and modern effect.

- **Responsive Design**: The project incorporates a responsive design approach, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

- **Minimalist Styling**: The overall styling is kept minimal to highlight the text animation, with a dark background and contrasting text colors.

### Project Structure

- **HTML File (`index.html`)**
  - Contains the structure of the webpage, including the title, heading, and paragraphs with animated text.

- **CSS Styles (`style.css`)**
  - Defines the styling for the webpage, setting a dark background, styling the wrapper, and specifying the appearance of the animated text.

- **JavaScript Script (`script.js`)**
  - Implements the text animation using GSAP. It selects elements with the class "hover," transforms the text, and adds event listeners for mouseenter and mouseleave to trigger the animations.

- **GSAP Library (CDN)**
  - The GSAP library is included via CDN to leverage its animation capabilities.
